# Local Stripe Setup

To develop features that rely on Stripe webhooks or billing flows, you can run the Stripe CLI to forward events to your local environment.

```bash
# Install the Stripe CLI if you don't already have it
stripe login

# Forward webhooks to your local server
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe
```

For additional details see the [Stripe CLI documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli).
